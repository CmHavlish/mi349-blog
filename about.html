    <p>Hi, I am Cameron Havlish, I am a senior at Michigan State University studying media and information with a focus
    in game/sound design and Information Technology. I am an avid car enthusiast, working on my own projects to varying
    degrees of success and also attending different car related events. Since I was a kid my family has been taking me 
    out to different events like the Auto Show, the Dream Cruise, or out to the track to watch them race. I am by no means
    a mechanic but I love to learn about how things operate and figure out how to solve problems. Outside of cars my other
    passions are
